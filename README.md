# "Drink Some Water"

"Drink Some Water" is a web browser IDLE clicker game, just as many that already exist (e.g. Cookie Clicker). The point of this project was to get a bit familiarized with the `JavaScript`, particularly `React.js` and refresh own knowledge and acquire new one on HTML and CSS.

## Results:

I consider it to be successful. A game runs in a browser, where a user can either click on the main `Bottle` on the screen to produce water bottles. Or buy upgrades that will do it for them. Currently the game has only 3 upgrades and is fully built for fun. No ads, no more than 1 web page, no plans to expand so far.

I also wanted to make graphics to something visual and as I enjoy pixel art - this is the style I chose to approach the task with.
